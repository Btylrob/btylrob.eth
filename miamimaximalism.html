                <p>If you forgot about me or dont know me at all, I have moved to Miami 2 years ago. Moving here was a big change in my enviroment but nesscarry at the time for personal developement and growth. I realized no where you move will ever be the magical places have it postive and negatives or more so trade offs, ie. for you to live in a very beautiful place you have to also realize thousands of other people find it beuatiful making the trip to the grocery store down the street an hour affair. Nothing wrong with that! Just somethings you have to trade in for the place of others, this place is not just for me. Moving here was a big motivation for me to start dreaming bigger and less 2dimensional. I feel like growing up in north goergia i was not really exposed to how the other side of the world lives. </p>

                <p>The goal in mind this year is to design a wardrobe for more practical use. When purchasing clothes i want to make it a habit in analyzing the verstility, ease of maintenence, sustainability, and Eco values which i will touch on later. In previous years i tended to buy clothes for the look but forgeting to apply it to how it would interact with my real world surrpoundings. I came up with this dumb equation that can calculate the average scores for a satifying wardrobe, Feel free to use it! Last thing is I think I reached a point where im starting to value the ethics behind clothing production and how enviromentally sustainable my item is. By any means im not an enviromental/ social justice warrior but i rather not put money behing unethical practices utilizing child slavery and unsafe working conditions.</p>

                <p>This year I want to dive deeper into my current undertsnading of Golang. I would say right now my knowledge of Go is surface level as i just use prior knowledge from other programming langauges like JS, and apply it with different syntax. At the end of the year I would like to design some appliations using Go to showcase on my portfolio for job prospects and more importantly person gain. I wouldnt mind to delve into learning some Rust as it has gained some traction in the space and its compiling times would be benefiical for some backend work i would like to do. Anyways I will highlight my progress on this page 1 year from today!</p>

                <h2>Maturity and Stoicism</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>I was inspired from chatting with friends over new years eve about different ways of approaching a new years resoltuion. And one of my mates said that instead of a resoltuion he would adopt a word that would reprasent his year which was stoicism. Im going to steal his idea this year and focus on being a more stoic individual. I picked up a new book for christmas, Gucci Manes Guide to Greatness, a book so far that has really inspired me to be more of a stoic individual and not let bad situation rule over my life. Last thing I want to work on is keeping my swearing to a mininum, growing up in the south swearing always seemed like a normal way to communicate feelings and emotions. I realized this year that it does not aid in proving the point on how bright minded of a person i am.</p>
