                <p>Sinces it the new years now, and we are theoretically supposed to be making resolutions on what we will more than likely forget a fourth of the way into the year, this blog post will offer some things i will be working on this year. If you are reading this and are not my family or friend, My name is Brandon a university student located in Florida. This website was created for fun but more importantly keep my family and friend updated with what I have been up too. I do not like social media nor want my image and personal life displayed because the internet can be a weird place. However I welcome you to my website where you can read up on my ideas and feel safe. -b</p>

                <p>The goal in mind this year is to design a wardrobe for more practical use. When purchasing clothes i want to make it a habit in analyzing the verstility, ease of maintenence, sustainability, and Eco values which i will touch on later. In previous years i tended to buy clothes for the look but forgeting to apply it to how it would interact with my real world surrpoundings. I came up with this dumb equation that can calculate the average scores for a satifying wardrobe, Feel free to use it! Last thing is I think I reached a point where im starting to value the ethics behind clothing production and how enviromentally sustainable my item is. By any means im not an enviromental/ social justice warrior but i rather not put money behing unethical practices utilizing child slavery and unsafe working conditions.</p>

                <p>This year I want to dive deeper into my current undertsnading of Golang. I would say right now my knowledge of Go is surface level as i just use prior knowledge from other programming langauges like JS, and apply it with different syntax. At the end of the year I would like to design some appliations using Go to showcase on my portfolio for job prospects and more importantly person gain. I wouldnt mind to delve into learning some Rust as it has gained some traction in the space and its compiling times would be benefiical for some backend work i would like to do. Anyways I will highlight my progress on this page 1 year from today!</p>

                <h2>Maturity and Stoicism</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>I was inspired from chatting with friends over new years eve about different ways of approaching a new years resoltuion. And one of my mates said that instead of a resoltuion he would adopt a word that would reprasent his year which was stoicism. Im going to steal his idea this year and focus on being a more stoic individual. I picked up a new book for christmas, Gucci Manes Guide to Greatness, a book so far that has really inspired me to be more of a stoic individual and not let bad situation rule over my life. Last thing I want to work on is keeping my swearing to a mininum, growing up in the south swearing always seemed like a normal way to communicate feelings and emotions. I realized this year that it does not aid in proving the point on how bright minded of a person i am.</p>
