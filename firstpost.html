                <p>Sinces it the new years now, and we are theoretically supposed to be making resolutions on what we will more than likely forget a fourth of the way into the year, this blog post will offer some things i will be working on this year.</p>

                <p>The goal in mind this year is to design a wardrobe for more practical use. When purchasing clothes i want to make it a habit in analyzing the verstility, ease of maintenence, sustainability, and Eco values which i will touch on later. In previous years i tended to buy clothes for the look but forgeting to apply it to how it would interact with my real world surrpoundings. I came up with this dumb equation that can calculate the average scores for a satifying wardrobe, Feel free to use it! Last thing is I think I reached a point where im starting to value the ethics behind clothing production and how enviromentally sustainable my item is. By any means im not an enviromental/ social justice warrior but i rather not put money behing unethical practices utilizing child slavery and unsafe working conditions.</p>

                <p>This year I want to dive deeper into my current undertsnading of Golang. I would say right now my knowledge of Go is surface level as i just use prior knowledge from other programming langauges like JS, and apply it with different syntax. At the end of the year I would like to design some appliations using Go to showcase on my portfolio for job prospects and more importantly person gain. I wouldnt mind to delve into learning some Rust as it has gained some traction in the space and its compiling times would be benefiical for some backend work i would like to do. Anyways I will highlight my progress on this page 1 year from today!</p>

                <p>Short and simple, my last goal would to reduce the amount of profanity I use on a daily basis. I come to a point where i relaized that not speaking proper and using profanity just makes you look uneducated.  </p>
